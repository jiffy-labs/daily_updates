# 2024-Jan-06

1. Fixed Gautam's Daily Update:
	1. Removed Gautam's Push from master
	2. Tried adding Rules for branch protection: Requires Enterprise Account. Even pre-commit hooks didn't work.
	3. Reviewed the issues:
		1. Can you please push the change to your respective branch, 
		2. And add links to whatever changes to made to see them easily.
		3. (A link to show ERC20 and NFT transfers)
		4. (ReadMe Link for the new API)
		5. (Link to the code)
		6. And create PR to main branch.
		7. Filename Incorrect:
			1. Year is 2024, not 2023
			2. The extension **.md** is missing.
		8. Also add learnings, and next steps (TODOs) for points where relevant.
		9. Other Comments: https://github.com/jiffy-labs/daily_updates/pull/2
2. Read on CMMIs
	1. References:
		1. https://www.cio.com/article/274530/process-improvement-capability-maturity-model-integration-cmmi-definition-and-solutions.html
		2. https://www.bmc.com/blogs/cmmi-capability-maturity-model-integration/
		3. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/capability-maturity-model-integration-cmmi/
	2. Evaluation:
		1. Marketing/Product/Engineering: At Level 1.
		2.  Sales (Grant) At Level 3.
		3. All 4 core functions (Engineering, Product, Sales, Marketing) reaching Level 3 in Q1'24
	3. ToDo: Add a backburner task to review current Levels after Jan month.
3. Generating Empathy in Gautam:
	1. Links Shared:
		1. https://www.intercom.com/blog/empathy-the-key-to-better-support-content/
		2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Evwgu369Jw
	2. Reasoning:
		1. The minimal updates given shows lack of empathy towards his colleagues reading the updates now or in future. This results in creating subpar work and communication.
		2. Work drive backed by Empathy for all internal and external stakeholders should result in more impactful behavior and work by an individual.
		3. There's still a lack of motivation for doing quality work. Reason for this remains unknown.
	3. ToDo: Figure out what can be done to generate motivation in right directions.
4. Read Further on Software Product Instrumentation:
	1. Metabase vs Mixpanel:
		1. References:
			1. https://stackshare.io/stackups/metabase-vs-mixpanel
			2. https://www.metabase.com/community_posts/what-is-the-difference-between-product-analytics-and-business-intelligence
		2. Take aways:
			1. Metabase is more towards BI (Actual Users and Product Adoption Metric)
			2. MixPanel is more for Product Analytics (How the product is working, where the drop offs are and what can be improved)
			3. Metabase (your own DWH) is more reliable long-term as all data points are captured. Automated tools like Mixpanel can be blocked by ad-blockers.
			4. MixPanel has pre-defined charts for funnels, event based visualizations which can be easy start things with.
	2. Read further on How to plan and start Product Instrumentation:

		2. Learnings/ToDo:
			1. Come up with criteria for Active User. (Extension: Define Different Stages of User Journey or activation instead of just one).
			2. Come up with Steps to track the Users in different journey for both products (API, Explorer).
			3. Plan for actual execution. This whole project could be a good way to bring in a new PM.
5. Conversations:
	1. Shu (Hexlink, Mizu Global): "I'm building a payment app and will need to do user op log query. However, the one in bundler is using ethers.log natively so the data will lost if the blockis too old", Still prototyping. Call Scheduled for Tuesday morning to understand more on what he's building.
		1. ToDo: Discuss and Plan for API pricing, branding & credits. And how the simplest billing integration. (Maybe stripe?)
