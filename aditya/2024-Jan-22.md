1. Went through the candide SDK for safe and the proposal
	1. SAFE Sdk toolings are very poor in terms of dev UX
	2. Candide, while trying, still hasn't simplified the SDK has much as possible
	3. We should default to opinionated SDK where a default bundler, paymaster, rpc, etc is set and anything else is available under options for those are curious. This take 0-1 as fast as possible for a dev completely unfamiliar with 4337, while allowing them to expand over-time as they want better use-cases.
2. Rupesh:
	1. Guidance on how to approach customer interviews:
		1. Instead of a fixed script, get the person to open up about their behaviour to understand their jobs to be done
		2. Dev Vs Non-Dev User of an explorer:
			1. Stayed focused on jobs to be done for that user, your questions will remain on what the user did before/after, why, when's the last and last to last time they did it.
		3. Asked them to again read the mom's test as he still hasn't. Made him add that as a task.
