	3. ToDO:
		1. Sending API usage reports

		3. Need to plan for implementing a compute cost based approach in future: https://moralis.io/pricing/ to support premium endpoints in starter plan
		4. Check the drop off between clicking for API access and actually filling the form (value of making it self serve)
2. Started Kraken Account Creation and Verification Process. Pending: Uploading Shareholders registry

3. Created Product/Growth Project and tasks list on Asana
4. Scraped Weekly Heap Usage Data For Oct, Nov
