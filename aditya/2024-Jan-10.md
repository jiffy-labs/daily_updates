1. Read upon why and how to do smart contract verification:
	1. References:
		1. https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/verifying/
		2. https://docs.blockscout.com/for-developers/information-and-settings/smart-contract-verification
	2. Learnings:
		1. Full Verification (Ensures altered (malicious) variable names & comments don't misguide people as the code bytecode doesn't include these)
		2. Done for public auditing and to ensure there are no backdoors.
		3. Contracts with immutable variables will require additional process for verification
		4. Can use sourcify to show fully verified contracts. (etherscan doesn't do this).
		5. Tenderly supports verifying sourcecode privately, i.e. only for team/collaborators. They this is useful during development phase. (has plugin on hardhat for this)
		6. Blockscout has an open-source plugin for Solidity and Vyper contracts: https://docs.blockscout.com/for-developers/information-and-settings/smart-contract-verification
