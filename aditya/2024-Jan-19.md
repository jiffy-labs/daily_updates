1. Conversation with OnceUpon:
	1.  They have 16 months of runway (Sounds like $150k/month burn)
	2. They have 1TB of RAM in total given to MongoDB servers hosting OnceUpon
	3. They are using Indexing.co to index data and stream it into MongoDB
	4. Mentioned he's confident OnceUpon Equity won't go to zero, they will atleast get acquired. (Sounds pretty bleak)
	5. Has no revenue so far. Was suggesting combining OnceUpon with JiffyScan could give then an opportunity to charge chains at a similar rate ($30k-$60k/year/per chain)
	6. Wanted to pay $80k for the product and $500k in Stocks, while doing a 50-50 revshare on JiffyScan grants that makes up the remaining $420k in two years.
2. Rupesh:
	1. Feedback on surface level knowledge currently. Gave him pointers on how to ramp up on the topic: Dive into the code of entrypoint, try out the getting started guide from stackup, follow it step by step on the terminal and actually implement it.
