1. Launched `/getAddressAggregatedData` API in Jiffyscan - https://dash.readme.com/project/jiffyscan/v1.0/refs/get_getaddressaggregatedata. 
    1. Tested it in `dev` and deployed it to `prod`.
    2. Updated [readme](https://dash.readme.com/project/jiffyscan/v1.0/refs/get_getaddressaggregatedata) docs.
    3. *TODO: The API is extremely slow ( 4-8 seconds ). Will need further investigation as to what is slowing it down.* 

2. Added JS and TS guidelines to notion docs - https://www.notion.so/adityaagarwal/Coding-Guidelines-7533d15f05454c828061fae8fb26c7d4
    1. Not all guideliness have been followed so far for JS and TS , but this doc is so that we follow it going forward.
