    3. *Learning: In development mode, bundler takes 0.002 seconds to go from outstanding request to submission on chain. <1s to process it on chain*
    2. *TODO: slow down bundler submission time, processing time and block production in the nodes to show the different states in the webpage*
    3. *TODO: Create a video of the demo*
