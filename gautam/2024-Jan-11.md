1. Worked on making the pre-chain user operation poc live - https://www.notion.so/adityaagarwal/Mempool-POC-demo-a11b33a77f50473bb6dfa130e550db7e
    1. *Learning: eth-infitism's bundler-test-spec repo is not configured properly, due to the recent change in entry-point ( 0.6.0 -> 0.7.0 ) , the spec test repo has broken 
    2. Setting the reference packages to the commits mentioned in the repo , makes the code base work for entry point 0.5.0 which is again inconsistent with the bundler-spec-test which is configured to ( 0.6.0 ).
    3. *TODO: Raise a PR for bundler-spec-test to using the right commits for testing 0.6.0 entry point.*
    4. *TODO: Raise a PR to perform bundler-spec-test's on entry point 0.7.0.* 

2. Deployed POC of the website like using vercel - https://jiffyscan-frontend-git-mempool-poc-jiffy-labs.vercel.app/userOpHashMempool/0xaa41755bc163d50e884243f939d7fb97c68cd75e4873afe665c71bb788d7920f?network=mainnet 
    1. Had issues using vercel with a server running in EC2 instances. `https` websites required API calls to happen through `https`. Server running in ec2 instance is by default http and will require change in future when we want to make this production ready.
    2. Temporarily we are currently using a lambda + API gateway as an intermediary to call the `http` server to get the mempool data from the vercel site. 

3. Connected with Nilesh ( engineer on contract ) and explained him the changes needed to track API product metrics
     1. Explained him the Elastic Search/Grafana set-up we have
     2. Set-up the indice for him to dump API data into
     3. Discussed the different approaches we can take to dump the data to ES.
