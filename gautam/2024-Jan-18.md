1. Used shovel for injesting user operation data to postgres DB
    1. Learning: Shovel configuration is limited to a config.json file and we can not do any kind of transformation other than fetching raw data.
    2. Learning: Shovel has options for backfilling, incase we have simple backfilling tasks , we can do that using shovel to our db. Not recommended for entry point indexing.
  
2. Used Flair for injesting user operation data to postgres DB
    1. Was not able to complete this, still trying it out. WIll get in touch with their team to get accurate costing out.
    2. Allows you to have multiple processes running on the same data set. Highly configurable, where in you can run an indexer from present and backfill the old data at the same time.
    3. Possibly expensive, where every event handler is charged $5/month and every chain charged $10/month outside RPC costs.
