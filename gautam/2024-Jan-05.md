6. Create POC for listening in on Alto Bundlers Mempool data - https://github.com/jiffy-labs/bundler-listener-poc
    1. Wrote server which listens to mempool data - [link](https://github.com/jiffy-labs/bundler-listener-poc/blob/master/src/db/index.ts)
        1. Different states currently provided by Pimlico are `outstanding`, `processing`, and `submitted` for userOperation. For User Operation bundler side of things, we get data as to when it was submitted(`firstSubmitted`) and when it was updated in the bundler (`lastReplaced`). Same for the transaction hash, there are two timestamps `lastReplaced`, and `firstSubmitted`. 
    3. Wrote handlers to store and retrieve the different states of the mempool data - [link](https://github.com/jiffy-labs/bundler-listener-poc/blob/master/src/index.ts)
